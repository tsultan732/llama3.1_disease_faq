        "Answer": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurs when kidney damage is so severe that dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to control symptoms and prevent complications and death. ESRD often occurs after kidney damage has been present for 10 years or more. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of ESRD.\n\nKidney failure can be measured by how well the kidneys are able to filter wastes from the blood (Glomerular Filtration Rate, or GFR). ESRD usually occurs when the GFR falls 10% to 15% below what is expected in a person with normal kidney function.\n\nHeart disease is the most common cause of death in people with end-stage renal disease."

    {
        "Question": "Why does he grind his teeth, his sister does not seem to suffer from a similar problem?",
        "Answer": "Children react differently to certain situations. One theory as to the cause involves a psychological component. Stress due to a new environment, divorce, changes at school, etc., can influence a child to grind their teeth. Another theory relates to pressure in the inner ear at night. If there are pressure changes (like in an airplane during take-off and landing when people are chewing gum, etc. to equalize pressure) the child will grind by moving his jaw to relieve this pressure."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does my son need therapy?",
        "Answer": "You will have to consult a dentist who will assess the extent of damage to the teeth. The majority of cases of pediatric bruxism do not require any treatment. If excessive wear of the teeth is present, then a mouth guard may be indicated. The negatives to a mouth guard are the possibility of choking if the appliance becomes dislodged during sleep and it may interfere with growth of the jaws. The positive is obvious by preventing wear to the primary dentition."

        "Question": "Is there an alternative to cardiac catheterization?",
        "Answer": "Coronary Angiogram will remain the â€˜Gold standardâ€™ for the diagnosis of coronary arterial disease. The 64 slice CT scan is the latest investigation that helps in mapping out the vessels of the heart with accuracy. The 64 CT scan software can re-create a 3D reconstruction of the heart and all its vessels and reveal narrow areas in the coronary arteries of the heart. This is a pain-free and non-invasive test as compared to a cardiac catheterization. The test requires an injection of contrast material in the peripheral vein and capturing high resolution images of the heart in about 5 beats or in a span of 10 to 15 seconds. One will need to hold the breadth for about 15 seconds and a Beta- blocker drug maybe given to slow the heart rate for this study. The sensitivity of the 64 slice CT is 96% and specificity 89% when there is any coronary artery narrowing or stenosis. The authors who conducted the study (Mollet et. al., presentation #1054-83, ACC â€˜05) comparing 64 slice CT with conventional coronary angiograms for coronary artery disease concluded that 64-channel cardiac CT can be reliably be used to detect significant coronary artery stenoses in patients with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome. This modality maybe useful in patients with low risk of disease. One must remember that 30 to 40 percent of catheterizations done in the United States do not find any significant narrowing of the coronary arteries. The latest 256 CT scanner will not require the need for beta blockers drugs and will take the better resolution pictures than a 64 slice at lower dose of radiation. The role of CT is the emergency room for patients with chest pain to rule out pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or acute coronary syndrome ( popularly called Triple Rule-Out) is already getting established and the newer technology are likely to help in establishing CT as the gold standard investigation for coronary artery disease."

        "Question": "Can having cataract surgery cause glaucoma?",
        "Answer": "Temporary rises in intraocular pressure are common after cataract surgery and can be brought under control by the short term use of anti-glaucoma medication. Rarely, a sudden rise of intraocular pressure can occur due to a blockage of the drainage angle by a swollen ciliary body or blockage of the pupil. These can be reversed by appropriate timely medical or laser intervention. Long term use of corticosteroid eye drops after cataract surgery can result in steroid induced glaucoma. Glaucoma is much more common after infant cataract surgery."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How long does it take to recover from cataract surgery?",
        "Answer": "Recovery from cataract surgery takes just a couple of days in most cases. You can read and watch TV after the surgery if you are comfortable with it. You can resume cooking after a couple of days as long as you are not exposed to strong vapors and fumes. You may bathe the next day, but water should not get in to your eyes for up to 2-4 weeks. Eye makeup should be avoided for at least 3 to 4 weeks, though it is better to consult your doctor before you start using it again. Activities like driving, heavy exercise and swimming will have to be postponed for up to 2-4 weeks. You can go back to work in a couple of days unless you are involved in heavy strenuous work or are exposed to dust or chemical fumes. You can drive as soon as your vision clears up, or if you have good vision in your other eye - confirm this with your doctor. Do not rub your eyes for at least a month after surgery."

    {
        "Question": "What will happen if a cataract is left untreated?",
        "Answer": "With nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataracts, there will a progressive diminution of vision which can hinder day-to-day activities. However, a cortical cataract can become mature or hypermature, which in addition to loss of vision, can lead to complications like phacomorphic glaucoma, phacolytic glaucoma, lens-induced uveitis and lens displacement. The eye becomes red and painful, and the outcomes may be less than perfect when operated under these conditions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is it dangerous to delay cataract surgery?",
        "Answer": "That depends on the stage of the cataract. A mature, hypermature and swollen cataract needs to be operated as soon as possible to avoid dangerous complications. Other types can be delayed without fear of complications; however surgery is required for visual recovery."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does one still need to wear glasses after cataract surgery?",
        "Answer": "If a monofocal intraocular lens has been placed, then only distance vision is corrected. The person needs to wear glasses for near tasks such as reading. However if a multifocal intraocular lens has been implanted, then near tasks can be achieved satisfactorily in most cases without glasses. Sometimes, some amount of residual refractive error may be present. This may be due to pre-existing astigmatism, surgically-induced astigmatism, tilting or displacement of intraocular lens. Glasses need to be used in these conditions. The first two conditions may also be treated with incisions made at the junction of the cornea and sclera either with a blade or a laser, and the latter 2 conditions may need surgical manipulation if severe."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does cataract need to be mature for surgery?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "I have cataracts in both my eyes. Can both of my eyes be operated upon on the same day to save on post-operative recovery time?",
        "Answer": "It is always better to undergo surgery in both eyes in 2 separate sittings. This is to ensure that any inadvertent infection does not affect both eyes simultaneously. A gap of 1-2 days between the surgeries of the two eyes is acceptable, provided there are no complications in the first eye."
    },
    {
        "Question": "My doctor says I need cataract surgery. However I have been having short-sight since childhood. Can this be corrected too?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "Is laser cataract surgery done without making an incision in the eye?",
        "Answer": "No. The eye is still opened, as the laser takes care of only some steps of the surgery. Moreover, an opening is mandatory to remove the cataractous lens and to implant the intraocular lens."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have undergone cataract surgery. Can I still donate my eyes after death?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "Do cataracts move in the eye?",
        "Answer": "Cataracts do not normally move in the eye. However, if the zonules (the fibers that anchor the lens in place) are weakened or disrupted either due to injury or hypermaturity of the lens or some other disease condition, then the lens may be partially or completely displaced."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If I undergo cataract surgery in one eye, do I have to undergo surgery in the other eye also?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I have to get admitted for cataract surgery?",
        "Answer": "Not in most cases. You can go to the hospital on the morning of the surgery, and go home soon after the procedure is over. However, if you have some medical conditions that need monitoring then you may have to be admitted for a day or two either before or after the surgery."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is an after cataract? Can I have a recurrence of cataract after surgery?",
        "Answer": "Cataract cannot recur after surgery. However you may develop an after cataract (or PCO â€“ posterior capsule opacification) which is a clouding of the posterior capsule of the lens (which is left behind during the surgery so that it acts as scaffolding for placement of the intraocular lens). When this happens, vision becomes poor after a couple of weeks to months of good vision. An after cataract can be treated by a simple laser procedure known as YAG laser capsulotomy, wherein an Nd:YAG (Neodymium: Yttrium Aluminium Garnet)  laser is used to make an opening in the posterior capsule thus making the visual axis clear again. This procedure takes just a couple of minutes and is entirely painless."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I am taking tamsulosin for prostate enlargement. Will there be a problem during surgery?",
        "Answer": "Tamsulosin is known to cause a problem known as IFIS (intraoperative floppy iris syndrome) in cataract surgery. Discuss this with your eye doctor, so that he may recommend a non-selective alpha-blocker such as doxazosin or alfuzosin as a replacement for a short period of time."

        "Question": "Which doctor should I consult for chelation therapy?",
        "Answer": "An ideal chelation drug should be effective with minimal side effects. It should remove only the desired metal and should not remove essential nutrients from the body. Also, it should remove the metal from the desired site of the body. Thus, the chelating agent should be able to reach the body site where the toxic accumulation has occurred, form a stable complex with it which is non-toxic to the body and can be easily eliminated. Unfortunately, currently, there is no ideal drug for chelation therapy. However, newer research to find better drugs for chelation therapy is ongoing."

        "Answer": "Despite years of research on CFS, it has not been possible to pinpoint the factors causing CFS. A largest ever study conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights that CFS may have a genetic link. In other words, individuals with certain specific genes may be more susceptible to develop CFS due to altered activity of the gene. These genes which play a critical role in mediating stress response can either confer an increased or decreased CFS risk. More studies are needed at this juncture to aid better understanding of the role of genetics in causing CFS."

        "Question": "Does CFS affect children as well?",
        "Answer": "Although the presence of CFS in adults has been well documented, very little is known about the prevalence of CFS among children and young adults. Some studies have documented the presence of CFS in children less than 5 years old. In a sample of 100, 000, nearly 5 to 6 children and 10-19 young adults are likely to suffer from CFS, according to a study conducted by Australian researchers."

Treatment depends on what the stones are made of."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is PTH?",
        "Answer": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by several small, bean-like parathyroid glands in your neck. Its \"job\" is to tell your bones to release calcium into your bloodstream. Too much PTH can become a problem in people with kidney disease.\n\nHealthy kidneys convert a hormone called calcitriol to its active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol lets your body absorb calcium from food you eat. When your kidneys are not working well, they start to make less calcitriol - so even if you eat calcium, your body can't absorb it. PTH kicks in to make sure you always have enough calcium in your blood. Over time, this can weaken your bones.\n\nA blood test can show if your PTH levels are above normal. If they are, your doctor may prescribe a form of active vitamin D."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have a family member with polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Should I be tested?",
        "Answer": "Since 60-70% of people with PKD have a family member with PKD, asking your doctor about being tested seems like a good idea. The first test used for PKD is an ultrasound to look at the kidneys and see if there are cysts. No contrast dye is needed, so this is a non-invasive test. Depending on tour age and cysts that are found, a diagnosis can be made.\nThis is more important if you are considering donating a kidney to someone who is related to you."

    {
        "Question": "If I have signs of kidney disease, what should I do?",
        "Answer": "After you have basic screening tests done, if you have signs of kidney disease, you should ask for a referral to a nephrologist, a specialist in treating kidney disease. A nephrologist will perform an evaluation then suggest medications or lifestyle changes to help slow the progression of kidney disease."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I just found out I have kidney failure. Does this mean I am going to die?",
        "Answer": "No. Dialysis or a kidney transplant can keep you alive when your kidneys fail. The more you learn and take part in your treatment, the better you can feel. Some people live for decades with kidney failure and there are others who are on dialysis for many years and continue to work and have a relatively normal lifestyle, however most studies show that the quality of life after a kidney transplant is better than being on life time dialysis."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I be referred to a nephrologist?",
        "Answer": "You should be under the care of a nephrologist if your creatinine clearance, a measure of your kidney function, is 30 mL/min or lower. This translates to stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nWhen you first find out you have CKD (even if it is stage 2 or 3), seeing a nephrologist at least once can help you develop a plan of care.

    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I start the process to get a kidney transplant?",
        "Answer": "If you have diabetes, strict controls of your blood glucose levels can help slow the progression of kidney disease.\n\nKeep your hemoglobin A1c, which measures blood glucose control over the last three months, to less than 6.5%. To reach this level of strict glycemic control, you will need to monitor your blood glucose closely to avoid hypoglycemia. You may need to use frequent insulin injections or an insulin pump. Talk to your doctor about your diabetes treatment options."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If I get a rejection after transplant, can it be treated or will I lose my transplanted kidney?",
        "Answer": "Study after study has confirmed that good blood pressure control can help slow the rate of CKD. This is especially true in people who have diabetes and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Keeping blood pressure under control also helps prevent heart disease and stroke.\n\nAccording to National Kidney Foundation (NKF) guidelines, you should strive to keep your blood pressure at or below 130/80 if you have CKD. If you have diabetes and/or proteinuria too, their current suggested target blood pressure is even lower at 125 / 75.\n\nFor most people with CKD, blood pressure drugs are also needed. The first blood pressure drug is likely to be an \"angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor\" (ACE inhibitor) or an \"angiotensin receptor blocker\" (ARB), because these drugs have been proven to slow the rate of some types of kidney disease. Other types of blood pressure drugs such as a diuretic (water pill) or a calcium-channel blocker may be added, as needed. Ask your doctor what you can do to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level."

    },
    {
        "Question": "How is Coffin-Lowry syndrome inherited?",
        "Answer": "Coffin-Lowry syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. In an X-linked inheritance, the mutated gene causing the disorder is present on X-chromosome (one of the two sex chromosome). Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have 2 X chromosomes in each cell. This means that all males with the defect will suffer from the condition. Since the defect is â€˜dominantâ€™, even if it is present only on one X chromosome, the female will also suffer from the syndrome. However, since the gene on the other X chromosome in the female may be normal, the symptoms may not be very severe.\n\nA male passes his X chromosome to his daughter and Y chromosome to his son. Thus, the daughter of an affected male can inherit the condition. On the other hand, the son does not get the defective gene and will be free from the syndrome.\n\nHowever, it has been noted that most people who suffer from the syndrome do not have a documented family history of the condition."

    },
    {
        "Question": "Why should a fecal occult blood test be done yearly whereas a colonoscopy every 10 years?",
        "Answer": "A fecal occult blood test is not as sensitive as a colonoscopy to detect colorectal cancers. A fecal occult blood test comes positive only if there is bleeding from the polyp or cancer, which occurs intermittently. On the other hand, a colonoscopy involves a complete direct examination of the lining of the colon and rectum. Hence, a fecal occult blood test should be done more often than a colonoscopy."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Which doctor should I visit to get a colonoscopy done?",
        "Answer": "You should visit a gastroenterologist to get a colonoscopy done.

The inflammatory response may subside once the exposure to the drug ceases or may lead to permanent damage and scarring of the liver."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does the concept of live donor work in liver transplant?",
        "Answer": "Unlike kidneys where a person can donate one of his kidneys, a live liver donor donates a part of his liver to the recipient. The interesting thing is that the liver has a remarkable capacity for regeneration and it grows back to its original size in the donor and to the normal in the recipient as well."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are MELD and PELD scores?",
        "Answer": "MELD is Model End stage Liver Disease and PELD is Pediatric End stage Liver Disease.\n\nThe MELD score is used for persons above 12 years and PELD score is used for children below 12 years.\n\nWhen a person is assigned to a waiting list for liver transplant, the MELD /PELD scores are calculated to determine how urgently the person needs the transplant i.e the probability of his dying within 90 days without a transplant.\n\nThe MELD score ranges between 6 to 40, and a higher score indicated more urgency.\n\nPatients with acute liver failure likely to die within a week without a liver transplant are accorded the highest priority."

As RBCs in the human body survive for 8-12 weeks before renewal, measurement of HbA1c can be used to reflect average blood glucose levels over that duration. This method provides a useful longer-term gauge of blood glucose control. The value of HbA1c is less than 6% in normal individuals whereas in prediabetes, it is 6.0-6.4% and in diabetics, it is above 6.5%. Higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes-related complications."

The balance of risks and benefits varies, though, depending on your age and other health problems. If you want a kidney transplant, you must contact a transplant center and ask for a transplant evaluation. It is not automatic. Only a transplant team can tell you that you are definitely eligible (or not eligible) for a transplant. You can contact one or more transplant centers and start to be evaluated when it seems likely that you will need dialysis within two to three years. Most kidney transplants are successful - more than 90% of transplants are still working one year later. Recent studies have found that the odds of good results are somewhat better with a \"preemptive\" transplant, done before dialysis is needed. Preemptive transplant requires a willing living kidney donor-probably a relative, spouse, or friend."

        "Question": "What are the dietary recommendations for kidney stones?",
        "Answer": "It is important to maintain adequate fluid intake so that the urinary output is at least 2 to 3 liters per day. Excess fluid reduces the concentration of stone-forming crystals in the urinary tract and helps to flush out crystals and small stones. Oxalate-containing foods like spinach and soya bean should be avoided by patients prone to calcium oxalate stones. The dietary calcium intake however should not be restricted. In fact, calcium in the diet binds to oxalates from food in the intestines and prevents its absorption, thereby reducing the chances of calcium oxalate stones developing in the kidneys. At the same time, calcium supplements should be avoided because the excess calcium will be excreted in the urine and combine with oxalates in the urine to form calcium oxalate stones. Vitamin D should be avoided unless you suffer from a deficiency since vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium and thereby its urinary excretion. Non-vegetarian food should be limited in patients suffering from uric acid stones. You can find more information in the link below:http://www.medindia.net/patients/patientinfo/diet-kidney-stones.htm"

        "Question": "What are the parts of the stomach?",
        "Answer": "The stomach is situated in between the oesophagus and the small intestine. It consists of 2 main areas. The proximal stomach consists of the cardia (uppermost area closest to the oesophagus where gastric juices are made), the fundus (place where undigested food is stored and gases needed for chemical digestion of food is released) and the body (bulk of the digestion occurs). The distal stomach consists of the antrum (food is mixed with the gastric juice here) and the pylorus (valve that controls the emptying of the contents into the small intestine)"

Some of these patients develop what is called as angle recession glaucoma many years later. So if you have angle recession, you need to undergo annual checkups with your eye doctor."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I forget to put my eye drops on some days. Is that ok?",

        "Question": "I am on regular anti-glaucoma eye drops. When I visit my doctor for follow up, should I skip the eye drops on that day?",
        "Answer": "No. The doctor needs to assess the efficacy of the medication, and that is possible only if you use your eye drops up to the visit to the doctor. Also, if your eye drops get over just a few days before your appointment, DO buy another bottle and continue using the eye drops till your visit."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I am regularly using eye drops for primary open angle glaucoma. Now the doctor says I have a cataract and require surgery. Do I need to continue my glaucoma medication after the cataract surgery?",
        "Answer": "That depends on what type of surgery is performed by your doctor. If you undergo only a cataract surgery then you will have to continue your glaucoma medications after surgery. However, if you undergo a combined cataract and glaucoma surgery, then you may be able to skip the glaucoma medications. The decision as to the type of surgery will be taken by your doctor after careful consideration and discussion with you."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If I am diagnosed with glaucoma, can I still drive?",
        "Answer": "That will depend on the degree of glaucomatous damage that you have. Your doctor will let you know after checking your vision and visual field. Decreased contrast sensitivity and diminished dark adaptation may make driving at night difficult in some people, even if day time driving is not a problem."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have been using eye drops for glaucoma for the past 2 months, but I am not able to notice any change in my eyes. Do I really need to continue my medication?",
        "Answer": "Anti-glaucoma drugs control intraocular pressure and prevent further ocular damage. If you have good control, then there will be no further deterioration of vision due to glaucoma. Vision that is lost cannot be retrieved. That is why you have not noticed any change. Failure to continue medication will DEFINITELY lead to progressive damage to the eye and consequent blindness and is not recommended."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is 100 day glaucoma?",
        "Answer": "Patients who have had an obstruction in the central vein of the retina are at increased risk of developing glaucoma due to formation of abnormal new vessels (neovascular glaucoma). It is so named since this occurs roughly 3 months after the vein occlusion."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have arthritis in my fingers and Iâ€™m having trouble putting the eye drops every day. This is especially bothersome since I am using 3 different glaucoma medications. Is there any way out?",
        "Answer": "If using glaucoma medications is becoming problematic, you should discuss this with your doctor, so that if found suitable, he can perform a laser procedure (laser trabeculoplasty) or one of the various glaucoma surgeries to reduce your dependency on eye drops."
    },
    {
        "Question": "My eye is blind from glaucoma. Recently it has become painful. Why is this?",
        "Answer": "This is the stage of absolute glaucoma. It is the end stage of any uncontrolled glaucoma. The eye is very painful. You may have to undergo a surgical procedure wherein either a drainage implant is placed, or the ciliary body is destroyed so that aqueous is no longer produced such as cyclophotocoagulation (destruction of ciliary body by laser) or cyclocryotherapy (destruction of ciliary body by application of extreme cold temperature). If a surgical procedure is not desired, absolute alcohol can be injected behind the eye to destroy the nerves that are causing the pain."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Recently my intraocular pressure was checked as a part of a routine eye examination, and was found to be high. Will I develop glaucoma?",
        "Answer": "Not necessarily. Optic disc and visual field changes do not occur in all patients with a raised intraocular pressure. Such a condition is referred to as ocular hypertension. You will have to have regular checkups with your eye doctor to make sure you are not developing glaucoma. However if you have a family history of glaucoma or other risk factors for primary open angle glaucoma, or if the intraocular pressure is very high (> 30 mm Hg), then the doctor might want to start glaucoma medication right away."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I went for a routine eye checkup because I am diabetic. The doctor said dilating my eye could precipitate glaucoma and recommended a laser procedure first. Why is this?",
        "Answer": "If on examination, the doctor finds that the angle of the anterior chamber in your eye is narrow, he will recommend a laser iridotomy (making an opening in the iris with a laser), because otherwise dilatation of the pupil in such cases may trigger an attack of acute angle closure. Once laser iridotomy is performed, it is safe to dilate the pupil."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have been following water therapy for some time. Can I continue to do so after a diagnosis of glaucoma?",
        "Answer": "No. Water therapy involves drinking a large quantity of water on an empty stomach in the morning. In fact this is one of the provocative tests for glaucoma, even though it is no longer used. Ingestion of a large quantity (half to one liter) in a very short period of time can result in a significant rise in intraocular pressure, and hence you should stop this water therapy immediately."

        "Question": "Can having cataract surgery cause glaucoma?",
        "Answer": "Temporary rises in intraocular pressure are common after a cataract surgery and can be brought under control by short term use of anti- glaucoma medication. Rarely, a sudden rise of intraocular pressure can occur due to a blockage of the drainage angle by a swollen ciliary body or blockage of the pupil. These can be reversed by appropriate timely medical or laser intervention. Long term use of corticosteroid eye drops after cataract surgery can result in steroid-induced glaucoma. Glaucoma is much more common after infant cataract surgery."

        "Answer": "This means that your kidneys are not doing as good a job as they should to help keep you healthy. Your kidneys normally remove waste products and extra fluid from your blood. These waste products and fluids come from the foods you eat and liquids you drink. If you have early kidney failure, some of the waste products and extra fluid remain in your blood.\n\nSometimes, early kidney failure may progress to total kidney failure. However, if you follow your doctor's orders carefully, you may be able to slow down this process."

Getting enough calories to maintain a healthy weight is very important at this time.Calories:Calories give you energy. Because you are getting fewer calories from protein, you will need to get more calories from other foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you get these extra calories from sugar and vegetable fats to help you get the right amount of calories.\n\nAvoid losing too much weight because it can cause malnutrition and lead to illness.\n\nSome ways to increase calories are as follows:\n\nIncrease unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils (made with corn, cottonseed, safflower, soybean or sunflower oils), olive oil and mayonnaise type salad dressings.\n\nUse sugar or sweets such as hard candy, gum drops, jelly beans, marshmallows, honey, jam and jelly.\n\nUse canned or frozen fruits in heavy syrup.\n\nIf you are diabetic or overweight, talk with your renal dietitian about the best way for you to get the right amount of calories for your needs."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What will happen if I don't follow this diet?",
        "Answer": "Your special diet may help to slow the loss of kidney function and to protect you from malnutrition. In later stages of kidney disease, the diet may also help you control the amount of waste products in your blood. If these waste products build up to very high levels, they may cause nausea, vomiting, hiccups, tiredness, weakness, sleepiness and other disorders."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Will my diet change over time?",
        "Answer": "Your diet may change as your kidney function changes. In the early stages of your kidney disease, your diet may be reduced in protein. If dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed, your diet will change based on the treatment option you choose."

    },
    {
        "Question": "What if I am a vegetarian?",
        "Answer": "Vegetarian diets by nature are high in potassium and phosphorus because of all the vegetables, whole grains and fruits that make up the diet. A vegetarian diet that includes eggs and milk is easier to work into the renal diet. The goal is to eat the right combinations of plant proteins while keeping potassium and phosphorus under control."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can diet help prevent the bone disease seen in many kidney patients?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Calcium and phosphorus are two minerals important for healthy bones. Diseased kidneys are unable to remove phosphorus from the blood as well as they should. Too much phosphorus in your blood may lead to loss of calcium from your bones. This may cause your bones to become weak and to break easily.\nAs mentioned earlier, phosphorus comes from many foods in your diet. By eating fewer high phosphorus foods, you reduce the amount of phosphorus in your blood, which reduces calcium loss from your bones. Your doctor may order a medicine called a phosphorus binder to keep your body from absorbing phosphorus from foods. This medicine should be taken with your meals and snacks as your doctor orders."

Especially in the Retail segment, Portability will bring in more competitive environment and better service experience.  In the current scenario, renewal of health policies can become a headache for the customers. In the portability scenario in the long run, Insurance Companies will have to win their renewals through better service, responsiveness and claims experience. The no. of policies an insurer is able to retain will reflect the customer satisfaction."

        "Answer": "There is a good chance of a price war in the younger age segment. Insurers could slash premiums in the lower age bands to attract portability of existing customers.  On the other hand, portability are not likely to help policy holders in the older age bands (say, 50 and above) and policyholders who suffer from pre-existing ailments. As such proposals are likely to be denied by the new Insurance Company.\n\nSenior citizens and people with pre-existing ailments (especially chronic ones) would not benefit a lot from portability."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How Will Data Sharing Between Insurance Cos: Affect Consumer / Industry?",
        "Answer": "The proposal and underwriting processes of Insurance companies will not change due to portability. The sum insured in the expiring policy cannot be the basis of what the new insurer will be ready to accept. The acceptance of risk would depend on the normal risk underwriting process. In fact, due to an already existing policy being declared for portability, the underwriting could demand additional claims history information for the past policies from the customer.Once the proposal is accepted, the waiting period credits would have to be given in the new policy. The underwriter of the insurance company will continue to hold the discretion to deny a proposal."

    {
        "Question": "Can a child have both Hernia and a Hydrocele?",
        "Answer": "Yes, they can. Normally the testis develops inside the abdomen. Just before delivery of the baby, the testis comes down into the scrotum. For this to happen, there exists a connection between the abdomen and the scrotum known as the processus vaginalis. This connection usually closes off around the time of birth. In some children, it remains open. Intestines can then move into the connection and appear as a hernia.\nIf the opening of the processus vaginalis is very small it does not permit the intestine to come thorough. All our abdomens contain some fluid. This acts like a lubricant, allowing smooth movement of the intestines. This fluid can trickle down through this small connection and this causes a hydrocele."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do all hydroceles need surgery?",
        "Answer": "No, when hydroceles occur in children below the age of one year, there is a 70% chance that they will disappear on their own. The connection tends to close off on its own by 2 years of age and the hydrocele disappears. Only if the hydrocele persists beyond 2 years of age will surgery be required. It is safe to wait until the age of 2 years for spontaneous resolution of the hydrocele."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who Requires a Hydrocele Operation?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "Why kidney stones in pregnancy are difficult to diagnose?",
        "Answer": "The symptoms due to a kidney stone may resemble those caused by the normal changes occurring in a pregnant woman who does not have the stone. For example flank pain due to hydronephrosis (which occurs in normal pregnancy) mimics the pain of kidney stone. Sometimes, small blood vessels in kidney become friable during pregnancy and rupture, leading to blood in urine. This harmless condition (if the bleeding is mild) can cause confusion as stones lead to blood loss in the urine too. Further, the pain due to kidney stones mimics pain of premature labor or ectopic pregnancy. Hence, doctors need to have a high index of suspicion in diagnosing kidney stones."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can kidney stones in pregnancy cause complications?",
        "Answer": "The most dangerous complication of kidney stone happens when there is a combination of urinary tract obstruction and kidney infection. This leads to pyelonephritis, pus in the kidneys and sepsis (infection in the blood). Surgical drainage is indicated in this situation.\nKidney stones also can lead to kidney failure, especially if the patient has risk factors like mild-moderate kidney impairment, a single functioning kidney, a transplanted kidney or polycystic kidney disease.\nStones which do not pass out may cause premature labor and can interfere with the process of normal labor, leading to increased C-sections. There are also associated risks from the diagnostic and surgical procedures used for the stones."

    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is it better to have a kidney donor who is a near relative or a family member?",
        "Answer": "A kidney from a family member is usually a better match. The tissue match is usually better and hence episodes of rejection of the kidney are much less. The long-term results are also marginally better from a tissue-matched kidney. It also means that it greatly reduces the length of wait for transplant operation. If you do not have a near relative or the relative is not willing to donate the kidney then you can get enlisted on the cadaver (brain dead) programme of the hospitals offering such a programme."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the risks in donating a kidney?",
        "Answer": "If a person is healthy and has two normally functioning kidneys then the risks in donating one kidney are very minimum. Some of us are born with one kidney and live a perfectly healthy life. In the same way a donor can lead a healthy life after donation. However, the donor will have some amount of pain after the operation and will be left with a scar both of which subsides with time. The pain goes away after a month or so and the scar usually starts fading away with time."

They should also have their â€˜Blood Pressureâ€™ checked at least once a year."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Will the transplanted kidney start working immediately after the operation?",
        "Answer": "In majority of the living related kidney operation, yes, it will start functioning immediately after the operation.

    },
    {
        "Question": "If I have rejection, will I loose the kidney?",
        "Answer": "Many transplant patients experience rejection episodes at some stage, particularly in the first 4 weeks. In most cases patient will require intravenous treatment and close supervision for several days. Scans and ultrasound tests or biopsy on the kidney usually is able to diagnose the rejection or malfunction of the kidney. It should be stressed that a rejection does not mean failure but means longer stay in hospital for treatment and stabilization. Only in rare cases rejection will not respond to treatment. In these situations the patient may require removal of the transplanted kidney. This fortunately happens only rarely."

    {
        "Question": "Can I have a normal sex life?",

It is usual to resume sexual activity as soon as you feel well enough and the wound is fully healed.\nIf you have any concerns about sexual problems, do discuss them with the doctor because they can often be remedied. Some patients worry about â€œSquashingâ€� the kidney but this does not happen."

Some women after transplant go on to become pregnant and have normal deliveries with perfectly healthy babies. However it is best to avoid pregnancy in the first two years after transplant operation. Pregnancy should be planned and contraceptive measures should be continued after a transplant. It must be remembered that 15% of the patients who become pregnant have deterioration in their kidney function. Careful monitoring of the immunosuppressants during pregnancy is an absolute must as Azathioprine (Imuran) can cause cleft palate / lip (splitting of upper lip) in the newborn and Cyclosporin is secreted in the milk and breastfeeding is not advised."

        "Answer": "Menopause marks the end of the time in life when you can become pregnant naturally, but it can also represent a new beginning - a time to focus on yourself and your needs. The first step is to learn all you can about the physical and emotional changes that may be ahead for you. In perimenopause, or the transition period to Menopause, the production of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone begin to fluctuate, causing a variety of symptoms, including hot flashes and mood swings. During this time, a woman may or may not have a period. These changes can begin as early as age 35 or as late as 59. In younger women who are having menopausal symptoms, and in women who have had a hysterectomy but still have one or both of their ovaries, a blood test called an FSH level, or follicle stimulating hormone level may be useful to confirm Menopause.\nIf you have your ovaries removed or undergo some cancer treatments, you may experience rapid onset of menopause, and may need special management of your symptoms. Menopause starts when the estrogen production falls permanently to very low levels and menstrual periods stop for good."

        "Question": "What is the relationship between mind wandering and creativity?",
        "Answer": "A recent study in 2012 showed that mind wandering (non-demanding activities) led to more creative solutions on the second attempt than situations that did not allow for mind-wandering (demanding tasks). In fact the study revealed that engaging in a non-demanding activity was better than not doing anything at all. Together they concluded that non-demanding activities provide greater chances of opening up creative inspirations."

        "Answer": "Heart palpitations or arrhythmias that occurs typically after a holiday following excessive alcohol consumption. Excess alcohol during holidays not only leads to an increase in road accidents and peopleâ€™s waist line, it can also make your heart skip or run. Sometimes they have shortness of breath, chest pain or even faint. This syndrome is not life threatening, but people must realize that heavy drinking over a period of time can lead to irreversible heart damage. There are no concrete theories on how alcohol affects the heart. It is believed that it is related to the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine and increase in the fatty acids in blood. When alcohol is metabloised, acetaldehyde is released that can cause a delay in the heartâ€™s conduction system. These patients are usually over 30years of age and have no history of heart disease. They do not have to be a chronic alcoholic either. The symptoms are transient. The heart reverts back to normal rhythm spontaneously if the patient abstains from alcohol. Sometimes antiarrhythmic drugs are required and rarely cardioversion to get the heart back into rhythm. Supraventricular tachycardia is the most commonly associated form of arrhythmia with the holiday heart. Atrial fibrillation is also widely associated with alcohol. In studies done in the US, 35% of new onset atrial fibrillation cases are related to alcohol abuse."

When there is no way to use the high amount of adrenaline produced, symptoms set in. They are heart racing, shortness of breath, hyperventilation, chest pain, sweating, giddiness, etc. They may even resemble a heart attack. Feelings of threat, fear and despair are present at this time. Upsetting life situations and depressions can lead to a panic attack. It can sometimes happen for no reason. Repeating attacks can lead to health problems. To deal with this problem, you may need to talk about your problems to a family member, friends or a counselor.

        "Question": "Can palpitations occur during pregnancy?",
        "Answer": "During pregnancy there are a lot of hormonal changes and shifts in the fluid volume. Increase in blood volume can cause a stress on the heart. Progesterone can increase the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood pumped from the heart with every beat. Occasional irregular heart beat; likely premature ventricular contractions are common. These do not affect the pregnancy or cause trouble during labor. Dehydration can also cause rapid heartbeats. There is a forward and upward shift of heart towards the chest wall due to gravid uterus. The heart being near to the chest wall causes unpleasant heart beat awareness. At times, pregnancy can reveal undiagnosed underlying cardiac problems. Patients should be tested to rule out the other causes of palpitations if their symptoms are persistent."

        "Question": "What is Urea breath test?",
        "Answer": "A urea breath test is an effective diagnostic method for H. pylori detection. This test is also used for studying the prognosis of treatment. Non-radioactive carbon (carbon -13 or carbon -14) is tagged with urea which is contained in the water which the patient drinks. If H. pylori bacteria are present in your stomach, they will break down the urea, eventually causing you to exhale carbon dioxide that contains the tagged carbon. If you have no H. pylori bacteria in your stomach, the urea does not break down and instead passes out of your body in your urine. This test is accurate and safe. (See also, lab test - Urea breath test)."

    {
        "Question": "What is the role of Urease enzyme?",
        "Answer": "The enzyme urease plays an important role in colonizing of H. pylori in the acidic gastric environment of the stomach. The enzyme is found readily on the surface and in the cytoplasm of the bacterium. Urease helps digest urea to produce ammonia and bicarbonate. Ammonia generated around the bacterial cells neutralizes gastric acid. This process benefits H. pylori in colonization, but is toxic to gastric epithelial cells."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How Prevalent is the infection of H. pylori in Humans?",
        "Answer": "The prevalence of H. pylori infection in humans correlates with socioeconomic status and age. Low socioeconomic status predisposes to infection.

        "Question": "What is CLO testing?",
        "Answer": "The CLO test is for Campylobacter-like organisms. At the time of endoscopy and biopsy, a pinch of tissue is removed and placed in a test solution containing urea, a pH colour reagent. The presence of H pylori results in hydrolysis of urea solution by Urease produced by H. pylori, resulting in a colour change due to pH change which occurred due to hydrolysis of neutral urea to alkaline ammonia (usually from yellow to red). In infected tissues the change in colour occurs within about one hour."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is MALT?",

    {
        "Question": "My elderly father is very well adjusted to progressives for all activities except climbing up and down stairs. Iâ€™m afraid he may trip and fall. Is there a solution?",
        "Answer": "Unfortunately, very elderly people even though well-adjusted with progressives, are at risk for falls during navigation of stairs. There are two convenient options for this. The first is to switch over to single vision spectacles during this activity alone while using his progressives for all others. This will involve carrying 2 sets of spectacles whenever he goes out. If he doesnâ€™t like this option, then he may use progressives where the intermediate correction is incorporated in the reading segment. This will help in easier stair navigation as well as for intermediate distance activities like computer use and reading labels off grocery shop shelves, as well as short term close reading. He may use a separate glass with single vision correction for prolonged near work with very small print. Either option requires 2 sets of spectacles; in the second, there will be less frequent switching between the two sets."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I was told that use of progressives takes care of vision at all distances and so would be comfortable for computer use as well. However, I spend many hours a day on the computer, and find that raising my head to maintain good vision at this distance is not comfortable for me for long periods of time. Is there a solution for this?",
        "Answer": "In your case, since you spend many hours on the computer, it would be a good idea to have a separated pair of spectacles exclusively for computer use, while using your progressives at all other times. You will notice that with exclusive computer glasses, the image quality is also slightly better and navigating a wide screen is more comfortable without side-to-side distortion."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have just been fitted with progressives for presbyopia. I find that when I move my head from side to side, there is a swirling effect and I feel there is distortion of the environment. This is making me feel very uncomfortable. I spent so much money on them but now I donâ€™t feel like wearing these glasses.",
        "Answer": "This is very common in people who start using progressives for the first time. When you wear bifocals, there is an image jump when your gaze shifts from the top to the bottom segment. With progressives, there is additional distortion on side-to-side movement. It takes some time to get accustomed to this phenomenon. It helps in the beginning, to consciously point your nose at whichever object you wish to gaze upon. This helps minimize side-to-side distortion. After some time, you will start doing this automatically without your knowledge. To minimize this effect, you can go in for progressives with a wide corridor. Wide corridor progressives are much more expensive than regular ones."

    {
        "Question": "I am 58 years old. I spend many hours at the computer and so use single vision glasses for intermediate distance. However I also need to refer to print material at regular reading distance and I am not able to manage with these computer glasses. I donâ€™t want to use progressives as I donâ€™t like the side-to-side distortion while using the computer. Is there a solution for this?",
        "Answer": "If you do not wish to go for progressives, then you could go in for a bifocal wherein the intermediate distance power is incorporated in the top segment, and the reading power is incorporated in the bottom segment."

        "Question": "I have been using contact lenses for myopia for many years now and I am very comfortable. However now at the age of 42, I am finding near work difficult. I tried multifocal contacts, but I didnâ€™t like them. I donâ€™t have much of near work activities, but reading is difficult.",
        "Answer": "You can continue to wear your contact lenses for distance, and wear additional spectacles exclusively for reading."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I was using glasses for reading for many years. Now I notice that I can read my novels more comfortably without my reading glasses. Why is this so?",
        "Answer": "This phenomenon is referred to as second sight. Initially you required reading glasses like any presbyope would, but now you have developed a short sightedness because of changes in your crystalline lens (nuclear sclerosis). Hence you are able to read without glasses; you will notice that distance vision requires the use of spectacles."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have been advised monovision contact lenses. I was told that one eye is corrected for distance and the other for near. Will that not strain my eyes if I use only one constantly for a particular distance?",
        "Answer": "No, it will not. However you must keep in mind, that there will be a bit of a compromise with respect to binocularity; that is to say, you must not go for a monovision option if you need good depth perception such as in the use of microscopes, telescopes or situations that require precise assessment of speed or distance of objects."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there any disadvantages to multifocal intraocular lenses? I have heard that most intraocular lenses that are implanted after crystalline lens removal are monofocal. Why is not every patient fitted with them if near vision is an expected problem?",
        "Answer": "Multifocal intraocular lenses can be associated with certain unwanted effects such as night halos, glare, loss of contrast sensitivity and difficulty in night driving. The quality of vision is also not as crisp as monofocal lenses, and so they are not for people with exacting visual requirements."

    },
    {
        "Question": "What do elevated levels mean?",
        "Answer": "Results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per millilitre (ng/mL) of blood. There is no specific normal or abnormal PSA level but less than 4 is considered normal. Values are correlated with a number of factors. The higher a manâ€™s PSA level, the more likely it is that prostate cancer is present."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does the PSA test have limitations?",
        "Answer": "Elevated levels may mean the presence of prostate cancer, benign prostate enlargement, inflammation. Infection, age, race are also factors leading to raised levels. Repeated tests (PSA levels and Digital Rectal Examination) may be recommended by your doctor if you do not have any symptoms suggestive of cancer. Suspicion of cancer may mandate a battery of investigations.A single raised PSA level is never the basis of any treatment it should always be repeated if it is elevated to reconfirm the level before asking for a prostate biopsy."

        "Answer": "It is not yet known for certain whether the PSA test actually saves lives. Sometimes it may lead to over diagnosis further leading to unnecessary treatment.\n\nFalse-positive test: The PSA level is elevated but no cancer is actually present. This means that a person may be wrongly diagnosed to have cancer when he doesnâ€™t have it.\n\nFalse-negative test: Sometimes PSA levels remain normal in spite of the presence of cancer. This might lead to failure in diagnosis the tumour."

    {
        "Question": "How often do I need a DRE?",
        "Answer": "DRE is a relatively simple procedure where the doctor studies the prostate by feeling it (palpating) with a lubricated, gloved finger inserted into the manâ€™s rectum.\n\nThe prostate gland is divided into different zones-the transition zone, central zone and peripheral zone. The peripheral zone can be felt through the rectum if enlarged. Most prostate cancer occurs in the peripheral zone. DRE is always recommended with PSA tests in men 50 years of age or older. The procedure lasts for less than minute. Though uncomfortable, the procedure usually doesnâ€™t cause pain. A painful examination may point to benign conditions like infection (prostatitis)."

    },
    {
        "Question": "Despite daily exercising, my resting metabolic rate has not increased. Why?",
        "Answer": "Aerobic exercise burns calories which helps in balancing the caloric intake in the body, thereby preventing weight gain.But they do not increase muscle mass in the body. Strength training, adds more muscle to body, leading to increase in resting metabolic rate."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is my resting metabolic rate lower despite weight loss?",
        "Answer": "Metabolic rate is altered by total body mass composition. When you lose weight, there is a decrease in total body mass, leading to decreased energy consumption for maintaining body''s vital functions. This results in lower RMR. Your resting metabolic rate (RMR) decreases as you lose weight."

So they are not recommended for routine use; they are usually used in special situations where daily removal is not possible; for example, in young children who have undergone cataract surgery without an intraocular lens. However, when used on a daily wear basis (removed at the end of the day and disinfected overnight), they can be very comfortable and you can go in for these for that purpose."

    {
        "Question": "When I go for a follow up visit to my eye doctor, should I have my contact lenses on or off?",

Your doctor needs to assess the fit and vision with your lenses. You may also have to take your lenses off while in the clinic, so be sure to take along your lens case and solution with you. Also, if you are going for a routine check-up, go towards the end of your lens replacement cycle, so that your doctor can evaluate your lenses and eyes to this schedule.

    {
        "Question": "Why is type 3c diabetes often misdiagnosed?",
        "Answer": "Unfortunately studies suggest that only 3 percent of patients with type 3c diabetes receive the correct diagnosis. The time taken for persons with primary disorder of the exocrine pancreas to develop diabetes is often quite long, up to 10 years in some cases. This may be one of the reasons why the association to the pancreatic disease is missed and often misdiagnosed."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is it important to diagnose type 3c diabetes correctly?",
        "Answer": "Most type 3c diabetes patients require insulin to control the symptoms. Oral agents such as gliclazide often used in type 2 diabetes patients are ineffective in controlling the symptoms of type 3c diabetes and expose the person to the dangers of high blood glucose levels.Also patients with type 3c diabetes benefit from pancreatic enzyme supplements for improvement of some of their symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is hypoglycemia common in type 3c diabetes patients?",

    {
        "Question": "Why is calcium so important?",
        "Answer": "Calcium is an essential nutrient that is not produced in the body, and we need to get enough from the food we eat. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. Calcium is also needed for muscles like the heart to contract, blood to clot, and nerve impulses to transmit in the body. If the bodyâ€™s calcium needs are not met through the foods, it will be withdrawn from the bones, which are the storehouse for calcium. Milk products are excellent sources of calcium. However, only fluid milk also contains vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorbs calcium and is equally important for bone health."
